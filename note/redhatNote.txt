###User Account###

su - username = switch user account
sudo -i = enter root account and root directory
 

#enter root account and current directory
sudo su

#change user password
passwd = user account
passwd user01 = another account

#create user account
useradd user01

#user delete 
userdel -r username


##permission
r = read
w = write
x = execute
X = special execute

u = user
g = group
o =	other
a = all

+ = add 
- = remove
= = set exactly

#cmd 
chmod +x = add execute

start = 0
read = 4
write = 2
execute = 1

r+w+x = 7
4+2+1 = 7 (all permission)
4+2+0 = 6 (read and write)
4+0+0 = 4 (read)


##change owner
chown
chown -R student Pictures = -R entire dictionary tree
chown :admins Pictures = give permission to admin
chown visitor:guests Pictures = owner:group syntax




#practice 
Press the Alt+F2 key combination to open the Enter a Command and enter gnome-terminal.

Change password -> student to 55TurnK3y -> using passwd

Alt+. key combination 

Finish

On the workstation machine, change to the student user home directory and use the lab command to complete this exercise. This step is important to ensure that resources from previous exercises do not impact upcoming exercises -> student@workstation ~]$ lab finish cli-desktop




#login
[student@workstation ~]$ lab start cli-desktop




#switch between tty
Ctrl+Alt and a function key (F1 through F6)




#ssh related 
[user@host ~]$ ssh remoteuser@remotehost
remoteuser@remotehost's password: password
[remoteuser@remotehost ~]$

user@host ~]$ ssh -i mylab.pem remoteuser@remotehost
[remoteuser@remotehost ~]$

[user@host ~]$ ssh -i mylab.pem remoteuser@remotehost




#permission 
chmod 600 mylab.pem 

Close the connection = Ctrl+D




#shortcut
Superkey+M = message tray

Ctrl+Alt+LeftArrow or Ctrl+Alt+RightArrow = switch between workspace 

Super+L (which might be easier to remember as Windows+L) = lock screen 

on-screen keyboard treats as modifier keys (like Super) are Shift, Ctrl, Alt, and Caps. The Esc and Menu keys are treated like normal keys and not modifier keys.
